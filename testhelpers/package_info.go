// Package testhelpers contains types and functions that may be useful in testing SDK functionality or
// custom integrations.
//
// It contains two subpackages:
//   - [github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v7/testhelpers/ldtestdata], which provides a test fixture
//     for setting flag values programmatically;
//   - [github.com/launchdarkly/go-server-sdk/v7/testhelpers/storetest], which provides a standard test
//     suite for custom persistent data store implementations.
//
// The APIs in this package and its subpackages are supported as part of the SDK.
package testhelpers

// Implementation note: the types and functions in this package are mainly meant for external use, but may
// be useful in SDK tests. Anything that is *only* for SDK tests should be in internal/sharedtest instead.
// Avoid putting anything here that depends on any packages other than interfaces, since then it might not
// be possible to use it in other areas of the SDK without causing a cyclic reference (that's why storetest
// is a separate package, so it can reference the main package).
