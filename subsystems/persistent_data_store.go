// PersistentDataStore is an interface for a data store that holds feature flags and related data in a
// serialized form.
//
// This interface should be used for database integrations, or any other data store implementation that
// stores data in some external service. The SDK will provide its own caching layer on top of the
// persistent data store; the data store implementation should not provide caching, but simply do every
// query or update that the SDK tells it to do.
//
// Implementations must be safe for concurrent access from multiple goroutines.
//
// Error handling is defined as follows: if any data store operation encounters a database error, or
// is otherwise unable to complete its task, it should return an error value to make the SDK aware of
// The SDK will log the exception and will assume that the data store is now in a non-operational
// non-operational state; the SDK will then start polling IsStoreAvailable() to determine when the
// store has started working again.
//
// Whenever a new implementation of this interface is written, it should have unit tests that use
// testhelpers.storetest.PersistentDataStoreTestSuite. This ensures that all of the interface methods
// are exercised consistently in various scenarios that might be encountered in real SDK usage.

	// become unavailable (e.g. the database connection was lost). The SDK will then call
	// IsStoreAvailable() at intervals until it returns true.
