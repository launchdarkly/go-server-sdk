type Config struct {
	// The base URI of the main LaunchDarkly service. This should not normally be changed except for testing.
	BaseUri string
	// The base URI of the LaunchDarkly streaming service. This should not normally be changed except for testing.
	StreamUri string
	// The base URI of the LaunchDarkly service that accepts analytics events. This should not normally be
	// changed except for testing.
	EventsUri string
	// The full URI for posting analytics events. This is different from EventsUri in that the client will not
	// add the default URI path to it. It should not normally be changed except for testing, and if set, it
	// causes EventsUri to be ignored.
	EventsEndpointUri string
	// The capacity of the events buffer. The client buffers up to this many events in memory before flushing.
	// If the capacity is exceeded before the buffer is flushed, events will be discarded.
	Capacity int
	// The time between flushes of the event buffer. Decreasing the flush interval means that the event buffer
	// is less likely to reach capacity.
	FlushInterval time.Duration
	// Enables event sampling if non-zero. When set to the default of zero, all events are sent to Launchdarkly.
	// If greater than zero, there is a 1 in SamplingInterval chance that events will be sent (for example, a
	// value of 20 means on average 5% of events will be sent).
	SamplingInterval int32
	// The polling interval (when streaming is disabled). Values less than the default of MinimumPollInterval
	// will be set to the default.
	PollInterval time.Duration
	// An object that can be used to produce log output.
	Logger Logger
	// The connection timeout to use when making polling requests to LaunchDarkly.
	Timeout time.Duration
	// Sets the implementation of FeatureStore for holding feature flags and related data received from
	// LaunchDarkly. See NewInMemoryFeatureStore (the default) and the redis, ldconsul, and lddynamodb packages.
	FeatureStore FeatureStore
	// Sets whether streaming mode should be enabled. By default, streaming is enabled. It should only be
	// disabled on the advice of LaunchDarkly support.
	Stream bool
	// Sets whether this client should use the LaunchDarkly relay in daemon mode. In this mode, the client does
	// not subscribe to the streaming or polling API, but reads data only from the feature store. See:
	// https://docs.launchdarkly.com/docs/the-relay-proxy
	UseLdd bool
	// Sets whether to send analytics events back to LaunchDarkly. By default, the client will send events. This
	// differs from Offline in that it only affects sending events, not streaming or polling for events from the
	// server.
	SendEvents bool
	// Sets whether this client is offline. An offline client will not make any network connections to LaunchDarkly,
	// and will return default values for all feature flags.
	Offline bool
	// Sets whether or not all user attributes (other than the key) should be hidden from LaunchDarkly. If this
	// is true, all user attribute values will be private, not just the attributes specified in PrivateAttributeNames.
	AllAttributesPrivate bool
	// Set to true if you need to see the full user details in every analytics event.
	InlineUsersInEvents bool
	// Marks a set of user attribute names private. Any users sent to LaunchDarkly with this configuration
	// active will have attributes with these names removed.
	PrivateAttributeNames []string
	// Deprecated. Please use UpdateProcessorFactory.
	UpdateProcessor UpdateProcessor
	// Factory to create an object that is responsible for receiving feature flag updates from LaunchDarkly.
	// If nil, a default implementation will be used depending on the rest of the configuration
	// (streaming, polling, etc.); a custom implementation can be substituted for testing.
	UpdateProcessorFactory UpdateProcessorFactory
	// An object that is responsible for recording or sending analytics events. If nil, a
	// default implementation will be used; a custom implementation can be substituted for testing.
	EventProcessor EventProcessor
	// The number of user keys that the event processor can remember at any one time, so that
	// duplicate user details will not be sent in analytics events.

	// The interval at which the event processor will reset its set of known user keys.
